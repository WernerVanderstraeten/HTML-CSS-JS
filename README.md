When the cell is clicked again, the cell is deactivated and the color is removed.

Whenever a cell is clicked with the right mouse button, a popup should appear where you can choose a
color. A minimum of 5 colors is required. The chosen color becomes the default color for each cell while
drawing.
• The color picker appears (fadeIn) when you press the right mouse button at the position of the
mouse
• The browser specific context menu is not shown when pressing the right mouse button
• The color picker disappears (fadeOut) when the mouse moves outside the color picker or when a
color is pressed
